    "An *encrypted order book* is an [order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) in which orders are submitted in encrypted form and remain encrypted until they are (partially or fully) revealed as part of a transaction. This document presents a generic template for an encrypted order book that relies on maintaining sorted arrays of orders submitted by clients. An encrypted order book implementation can be built based on this template by providing implementations of the base functions (for example, using a secure multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption scheme) that can operate on encrypted data."

    "The implementation template presented in this document relies on data structures and algorithms that are chosen based on their compatibility with secure computation schemes and protocols such as secure multi-party computation (MPC). When these data structures and algorithms are implemented using such schemes or protocols, the encrypted order book possesses certain privacy features. However, these features also introduce some costs and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Overview.** The implementation presented in this document is described briefly below. This description focuses on the functional (rather than cryptographic) parts of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The *operator* of the encrypted order book initializes and maintains two sorted arrays of a fixed size $k$ of orders: one for asks and one for bids. The initialized arrays are filled with *null* orders (*i.e.*, placeholder orders that do not match any other order).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When an individual *client* submits an *order* (a proposed *transaction* specifying a price and quantity):\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. the order is added as the first entry in *both* arrays (overwriting the entries in those positions);\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. both arrays are sorted by swapping contiguous pairs of entries (from the bottom to the top) such that null orders are always demoted and orders with the highest (for bids) or lowest (for asks) price are promoted;\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. the top array entries (one from each array) are compared to determine if a *transaction* can be executed; and\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. the top array entries are updated and processing resumes at step (b) above (if a transaction was executed) or no further processing occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once exactly $k$ orders have been submitted, the order book does not accept any further orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Privacy Features.** If individual orders are encrypted and the functions in the implementation that process orders are implemented using a compatible secure computation scheme, the encrypted order book ensures that (over the course of the order book's operation) the operator learns *only* (1) the number of orders submitted by each client and (2) the executed transactions (including their quantity and price). Notably, the operators *does not* learn any information about an order (*i.e.*, whether it is a bid or an ask, its price, or its quantity) if it does not contribute to a transaction, and also has no way to detect whether a transaction partially or fully fulfilled the orders on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations and Costs.** The most significant limitation of an implementation is that the number of orders $k$ that can be submitted must be fixed in advance and cannot be increased. The most significant computation costs (which may also include communication costs in the case of MPC protocols) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $O(k)$ comparison and conditional operations must be performed after each submission of an order, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $O(k)$ *additional* comparison and conditional operations must be performed for *every* transaction that is detected and executed as a consequence of an order submission."
